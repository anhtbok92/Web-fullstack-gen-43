            <p>I live and work in Hanoi. At my day job, I develop the interface of websites. In my free time, I also
              work as a freelancer. <br><br>

              Before that, I studied information technology in a university. With the ability to self-study and
              self-study, I was able to work earlier than friends in the same industry. <br>

              While my focus is mobile-first responsive websites with HTML, JavaScript , Iâ€™ve also worked with Python,
              it's really wonderful ðŸ˜€ <br><br>

              Just the way you are and trust your brain!</p>
